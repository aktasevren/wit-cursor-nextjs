      'Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather” is famous not only for its performances and storytelling, but also for its unmistakable sense of place. The film moves between New York and Sicily, using real streets, churches and countryside to ground the Corleone family’s story in the real world.',
      'Many of the New York scenes were filmed in and around Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Locations such as the East Village, Little Italy and Staten Island stand in for the Corleone family’s territory. Several interiors were shot on sound stages, but the exteriors use real brownstones, storefronts and neighborhood streets that still exist today.',
      'One of the most visited locations is the church used for the baptism sequence, which intercuts religious ritual with a montage of hits across the city. The production used real churches and practical locations to give the sequence a grounded, documentary-like texture. Fans often visit these spots to stand in the same aisles and side streets that appear in the film.',
      'The Sicilian portion of the story was filmed in several small towns rather than in Corleone itself. Places like Savoca and Forza d’Agrò offered a better-preserved, cinematic version of rural Sicily. Bar Vitelli, where Michael meets Apollonia’s father, is a real café that still trades heavily on its connection to the movie.',
      'If you are planning a trip, many tour companies now offer “Godfather” location tours that combine coastal drives, hilltop villages and behind-the-scenes stories. On Where Was It Filmed, you can search “The Godfather” to see these locations on an interactive map, filter them and save your favorites for your own itinerary.',

      'When audiences first saw “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” in 1977, Tatooine felt like a completely new world. In reality, the production team combined North African deserts, English sound stages and California canyons to construct the galaxy far, far away.',
      'Many of the most iconic Tatooine shots were filmed in Tunisia. The desert around Nefta and Tozeur provided endless dunes and salt flats, while traditional underground homes in Matmata became the Lars family homestead. You can still stay in some of these troglodyte structures, which now proudly display their connection to the film.',
      'The exterior of Mos Eisley and several canyon sequences used locations such as Sidi Bouhlel and Chott el Jerid. These spaces, with their layered rock formations and open horizons, gave George Lucas the ability to stage swoops, landspeeders and blaster fights in a way that felt tangible.',
      'Back in England, Elstree Studios hosted the Death Star interiors, Rebel briefing rooms and hangar bays. The production built full-scale corridors and control rooms, which were later referenced and expanded in the sequels and spin-offs. Some of those sets have inspired theme-park recreations and fan builds around the world.',
      'On Where Was It Filmed you can explore these locations on a single map. Search for “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” to see Tatooine villages, canyon vantage points and Death Star-adjacent spots that you can actually visit.',

      'Peter Jackson’s adaptation of “The Lord of the Rings” permanently changed how film fans see New Zealand. The country’s mountains, rivers and rolling farmland provided real-world foundations for Middle-earth, especially in “The Fellowship of the Ring”, where the fellowship travels through multiple regions.',
      'Hobbiton, one of the most famous locations, was built on a farm near Matamata in the Waikato region. The set was partially dismantled after filming, then rebuilt as a permanent attraction when the Hobbit trilogy went into production. Today it is one of the world’s most popular film-location tours, complete with guided walks and themed food.',
      'Rugged landscapes such as Tongariro National Park and the Remarkables mountain range doubled for Mordor and the Misty Mountains. Hikers will recognize some of the ridges and valleys from classic shots of the fellowship crossing snow-covered passes or fleeing from ringwraiths.',
      'Smaller locations, like rivers near Glenorchy or forests outside Wellington, were used for brief but memorable scenes: the Nazgûl crossing the river, the approach to Rivendell, or the company leaving the Shire. Many of these spots are public land, which means visitors can combine normal hiking itineraries with film-history pilgrimages.',
      'New Zealand tourism now actively promotes “Middle-earth” itineraries. On Where Was It Filmed, you can see these locations on an interactive map, filter by region and create a custom route that follows the fellowship’s journey.',

      'Finding real movie locations can feel like detective work, but you do not need insider access to get started. With a mix of online tools, official credits and a bit of curiosity, you can track down many filming spots near you.',
      'Start by paying close attention to end credits. Many productions list local film commissions, city names or even specific streets. Combined with a pause button, you can cross-reference visible shop signs, unique buildings or skyline shapes with online maps.',
      'City film offices and tourism boards often publish lists of productions that shot in their jurisdiction. Some even maintain public maps or PDF guides that highlight popular spots. These are reliable sources because they come directly from permitting records.',
      'Fan communities and wikis can fill in the gaps, especially for cult films or non‑English productions. However, always cross-check with satellite imagery or street-level photos to avoid misinformation. Where Was It Filmed focuses on verified coordinates to keep the data trustworthy.',
      'Finally, when you visit a location, be respectful. Many famous scenes were shot in residential neighborhoods or working businesses. Take your photos, enjoy the moment, and remember that everyday life continues around your favorite cinematic memories.',

      '“Set‑jetting” is the term used for travel inspired by movies and TV shows. Instead of choosing a destination first and then looking for things to do, set‑jetters start with a film they love and build a trip around its locations.',
      'Streaming platforms and global releases have made this trend more visible. A single breakout series can turn a quiet town into an international attraction almost overnight. Local cafés, staircases or scenic viewpoints suddenly become selfie magnets.',
      'For travelers, set‑jetting offers a new way to connect with stories. Standing where a favorite character stood, or walking through a recognisable street, can make a fictional world feel closer. It also encourages visitors to explore neighborhoods outside the usual tourist centers.',
      'However, this attention can put pressure on small communities. Responsible set‑jetting means following local rules, supporting independent businesses and avoiding disruptive behaviour. Many destinations now publish guidelines to help visitors enjoy locations without overwhelming them.',
      'Tools like Where Was It Filmed help by spreading visits across multiple spots instead of concentrating everyone in a single alleyway or corner. When you build a trip with our map, you can mix iconic scenes with lesser-known locations and discover more of each city.',

      'Behind every pin on our map there is a chain of data decisions. Movie databases, fan wikis and production notes often describe locations in natural language: “village near the canyon”, “street in central London”, or simply a country name. Turning that into a coordinate that a map can understand is a careful process.',
      'First, we normalise the raw text. That means stripping formatting, separating scene descriptions from possible addresses, and detecting languages or obvious place names. In some cases we split a single note into a “scene description” and a “geocoding hint” so that we can preserve both.',
      'Next, we send the geocoding hint to an open-source geocoder backed by OpenStreetMap data. We resolve ambiguous results by comparing them with other locations from the same movie: if most scenes for a film cluster in Tunisia, for example, a random result in Canada is likely wrong.',
      'We also keep track of confidence levels. High-confidence results can be displayed directly, while low-confidence ones may be hidden or flagged for manual review. Over time, community feedback and better data help us promote more points from “uncertain” to “verified”.',
      'This approach lets Where Was It Filmed scale to thousands of titles while still striving for accuracy. Each location on the map is more than a dot: it is a tiny piece of detective work connecting cinema to geography.',

      'London’s mix of old and new architecture makes it equally flexible. Period dramas, spy thrillers and contemporary stories can all find appropriate backdrops within a few Underground stops of each other. Look for filming around the Thames, in the City, and in smaller mews streets.',
      'Tokyo, meanwhile, turns up in everything from anime to cyberpunk thrillers.

      'For many viewers, discovering where a movie was shot is almost as satisfying as watching the film itself. Locations anchor fictional events to real coordinates, creating a bridge between imagination and everyday geography.',
      'Standing in a place you have only seen on screen often creates a strange double exposure: the real street exists, with its current shops and traffic, but layered on top of it is the memory of a chase, a conversation or a quiet character moment. Fans return to these places to relive the emotional impact of those scenes.',
      'Locations can also change how we interpret a story. Knowing that a futuristic city was actually filmed in an existing financial district, or that a remote village is only a short train ride from a major hub, reframes the narrative in a more grounded way. It reminds us that film crews had to negotiate with real space and communities.',

      'The first step is to pick a focus. You can choose a single franchise, like “Lord of the Rings”, or a theme such as desert chases, coastal towns or science‑fiction cities. A clear theme makes it easier to select locations that fit into a sensible geographic path.',
